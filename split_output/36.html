<pre>[37:62; 44:43
and 56:52], the Quraysh were threatened with it. Abu Jahl said: ‘Do you know what this Zaqqum, with which
Muhammad threatens you, is?’ They said: ‘No!’ He said: ‘Meat and broth with cream. By Allah, if he let us

Accursed Tree in the Qur’an…) saying: this tree is repulsive (We warn them, but it increaseth them in
naught save gross impiety)”.</pre>
