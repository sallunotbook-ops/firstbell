<pre>[92:5-6]
(As for him who giveth and is dutiful (toward Allah) and believeth in goodness)

[92:5-6]. Abu ‘Abd Allah
Muhammad ibn Ibrahim informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn Ja‘far ibn Haytham al-Anbari&gt; Ja‘far ibn Muhammad
ibn Shakir&gt; Qubaysah&gt; Sufyan al-Thawri&gt; Mansur and al-A‘mash&gt; Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubaydah&gt; Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman
al-Sulami&gt; ‘Ali who related that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “There is
no one amongst you except that his abode is registered either in Paradise or in hell!” Some asked: “O
Messenger of Allah, shall we then not rely [on works]?” He said: “Do perform works, everyone is helped to
follow that which he was created for”, and then he recited (As for him who giveth and is dutiful (toward
Allah) and believeth in goodness, surely We will ease his way unto the state of ease). This was narrated by
Bukhari&gt; Abu Nu‘aym&gt; al-A‘mash and also by Muslim&gt; Abu Zuhayr ibn Harb&gt; Jarir&gt; Mansur. ‘Abd alRahman ibn Hamdan informed us&gt; Ahmad ibn Ja‘far ibn Malik&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal&gt; Ahmad
ibn Muhammad ibn Ayyub&gt; Ibrahim ibn Sa‘d&gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah&gt; Ibn Abi
‘Atiq&gt; ‘Amir ibn ‘Abd Allah&gt; someone from his family who related that Abu Quhafah said to his son Abu
Bakr: “O my son, I see that you only free weak slaves. If you must free slaves, why do you not free strong
ones who would defend you and stand against anyone who would want to harm you?” Abu Bakr responded:
“O father, I have my own reasons for doing what I do”. It was said: these verses were revealed about him
and what his father had said (As for him who giveth and is dutiful (toward Allah) and believeth in goodness)
up to the end of the Surah. Someone heard Ibn al-Zubayr say while he was on the pulpit: “Abu Bakr used to
buy weak slaves and then free them. His father said to him: ‘Why do you not buy slaves who can defend
you?’ Abu Bakr responded: ‘It is not my defence that I seek’, and so the following verses were revealed
about him (Far removed from it will be the righteous who giveth his wealth that he may grow (in goodness))

[92:17-18] up to the end of the Surah”. ‘Ata’ reported that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “Upon embracing Islam, Bilal —
who was a slave of ‘Abd Allah ibn Jud‘an — proceeded to the idols [of the Ka‘bah] and defecated on them.
The idolaters complained to Ibn Jud‘an about what Bilal had done and so he gave Bilal to them along with
one hundred camels to be sacrificed for their gods. The idolaters took Bilal and tortured him in the
scorchedness of the desert. All he said while he was being tortured was “Uniquely One! Uniquely One!” The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, happened to pass by him and he said to him: ‘The
Uniquely One will save you!’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then informed Abu
Bakr, saying: ‘Bilal is being tortured for the sake of Allah!’ Abu Bakr took with him a pound of gold and went
and bought Bilal. The idolaters said: ‘Abu Bakr did what he did only because he is obliged to Bilal for a
favour’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And none hath with him any favour for reward, except as
seeking (to fulfil) the purpose of his Lord Most High. He verily will be content)

[92:19-21]”.</pre>
