[107:1-2]
(Hast thou observed him who belieth religion? That is he who repelleth the orphan)

[107:1-2]. Muqatil and
al-Kalbi said: “This Surah was revealed about al-‘As ibn Wa’il al-Sahmi”. And Ibn Jurayj said: “Abu Sufyan ibn
Harb was in the habit of slaughtering two camels every week. On one occasion, an orphan came to him
asking him for something. Abu Sufyan responded by hitting him with a stick. And so Allah, exalted is He,
revealed (Hast thou observed him who belieth religion? That is he who repelleth the orphan)”.
