<pre>[74:1-4]
(O thou enveloped in thy cloak…)

[74:1-4]. Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Muqri’ informed us&gt; ‘Abd alMalik ibn al-Walid&gt; his father&gt; al-Awza‘i&gt; Yahya ibn Abi Kathir&gt; Abu Salamah&gt; Jabir who related that the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to them: “I stayed in Hira’ for a month and
when my stay came to an end, I came down. As I was in the middle of the valley, I was called. I looked in
front and behind me, to my right and to my left, but could not see anyone. I was called once again. I raised
my head, and I saw on a throne in midair [i.e. Gabriel peace be upon him]. I said: ‘Wrap me up, wrap me
up!’ And they threw water over me. Allah, glorified and majestic is He, then revealed (O thou enveloped in
thy cloak, Arise and warn! Thy Lord magnify, Thy raiment purify)”. Narrated by Muslim&gt; Zuhayr ibn Harb&gt;
al-Walid ibn Muslim&gt; al-Awza‘i.

[74:11-24]
(Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely…)

[74:11-24]. Abu’l-Qasim al-Hudhami informed us&gt; 
161
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Nu‘aym Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Saghani&gt; Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Dabari&gt; ‘Abd alRazzaq&gt; Ma‘mar&gt; Ayyub al-Sikhtiyyani&gt; ‘Ikrimah&gt; Ibn ‘Abbas who related that al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah
went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who read the Qur’an to him and it seemed as if his
heart softened to it. Abu Jahl heard of this. He went to him and said: “O uncle, your clan want to collect
money to give it to you, for you went to Muhammad exposing yourself to his message”. He said: “The
Quraysh know well that I am among its wealthiest”. Abu Jahl said: “Then say something about him which
will let your people know that you condemn and dislike him”. He said: “But what shall I say? By Allah, there
is not a man among you who is more knowledgeable about poetry and its composition than me. By Allah,
what he says does not resemble any poetry. By Allah, the speech which he utters is sweet and graceful,
fruitful at the top, copious at the bottom; it has the upper hand and nothing has the upper hand over it. But
let me think about what I shall say about it. Then he said [as reported by the Qur’an] (This is naught else
than magic from of old)

[74:24], which he simply learnt from others”. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed
(Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely…), and the other verses which follows it. Mujahid said:
“Al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah was in the habit of visiting the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and
Abu Bakr so much so that the Quraysh thought he was going to embrace Islam. Abu Jahl then said to him:
‘The Quraysh claim that you visit Muhammad and Ibn Abi Quhafah to share food with them’. Al-Walid said to
the Quraysh: ‘You are people of noble lineages and sound minds, but you claim that Muhammad is mad.
Have you ever seen him seized by a bout of madness?’ They said: ‘No!’ He said: ‘And you claim that he is a
soothsayer; have you ever seen him soothsaying?’ They said: ‘No!’ He said: ‘You claim that he is a poet;
have you ever heard him utter poetry?’ They said: ‘No!’ He said: ‘You claim that he is a liar; have you ever
caught him lying?’ They said: ‘No!’ The Quraysh said to al-Walid: ‘What is he, then?’ He thought for a while,
looked and frowned and then said: ‘He is nothing but a sorcerer’, hence Allah’s saying (For lo! he did
consider; then he planned…)

[74:12] up to His saying (This is naught else than magic from of old)”.</pre>
