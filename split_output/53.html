<pre>[54:1], the unbelievers said to each other:
&#x27;This man claims that the Day of Judgement is near, so refrain from some of the things you usually do until
we see what happens&#x27;. When they saw that nothing happened, they said: &#x27;Nothing happened&#x27;, and so Allah,
exalted is He, revealed (Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in heedlessness…)

[54:1]
(The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain)

[54:1]. Abu Hakim ‘Aqil ibn Muhammad al-Jurjani
informed us (through verbal authorisation)&gt; Abu’l-Faraj al-Qadi&gt; Muhammad ibn Jarir&gt; al-Husayn ibn Abi
Yahya al-Maqdisi&gt; Yahya ibn Hammad&gt; Abu ‘Awanah&gt; al-Mughirah&gt; Abu’l-Duha&gt; Masruq&gt; ‘Abd Allah who
said: “The moon was split at the time of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, so the
Quraysh said: ‘This is an act of sorcery from the son of Abu Kabshah; he has cast a spell on you. Ask,
therefore, the travellers whether they saw the moon split’. They asked some travellers and they confirmed it.
Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. And if they behold
a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion)

[54:1-2]”.

[54:47-49]
(Lo! the guilty are in error and madness… Lo! We have created every thing by measure)

[54:47-49]. Abu’lQasim ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Sarraj informed us (by dictation)&gt; Abu Muhammad ‘Abd Allah ibn
Muhammad ibn Musa al-Ka‘bi&gt; Hamdan ibn Salih al-Ashajj&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Abi Rawwad&gt; 
145
Sufyan al-Thawri&gt; Ziyad ibn Isma‘il al-Makhzumi&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abbad ibn Ja‘far&gt; Abu Hurayrah who
said: “The Quraysh came to dispute the question of Destiny. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed (Lo! the
guilty are in error and madness… Lo! We have created every thing by measure)”. This was narrated by
Muslim from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah&gt; Waki‘&gt; Sufyan. By Allah, I bear witness that Abu’l-Harith
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahim al-Hafiz informed us in Jurjan; he said: “By Allah, I bear witness that Abu
Nu‘aym Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Bazzaz informed us; he said: ‘By Allah, I bear witness that I
heard ‘Ali ibn Jandal saying: ‘By Allah, I bear witness that I heard Abu’l-Hasan Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn
Ubayy in Khurasan say: ‘By Allah, I bear witness that I heard ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Saqr al-Hafiz say: ‘By Allah, I
bear witness that I heard ‘Ufayr ibn Ma‘dan say: ‘by Allah, I bear witness that I heard Salim ibn ‘Amir say:
‘By Allah, I bear witness that I heard Abu Umamah al-Bahili say: ‘By Allah, I bear witness that I heard the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, say: ‘This verse was revealed about the deniers of
Destiny (al-Qadariyyah): (Lo! the guilty are in error and madness… Lo! We have created every thing by
measure). Abu Bakr ibn al-Harith related to us&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Asfahani&gt; Jarir ibn Harun&gt; ‘Ali
al-Tanafisi&gt; ‘Ubayd Allah ibn Musa&gt; Bahr al-Saqa’&gt; A Shaykh from Quraysh&gt; ‘Ata’ who said: “The bishop of
Najran came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘O Muhammad, you
claim that sins are created by measure and that the seas and heaven are also created by measure. If it is
true that the seas and heaven are created by measure, sins nevertheless cannot be’. The Messenger of
Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘You are Allah’s adversaries!’ And then Allah, exalted is He,
revealed (Lo! the guilty are in error and madness) up to His words (Lo! We have created every thing by
measure)”. Abu Bakr informed us&gt; ‘Abd Allah&gt; ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Hasan&gt; Ahmad ibn al-Khalil&gt; ‘Abd
Allah ibn Raja’ al-Azdi&gt; ‘Amr ibn ‘Ala’, the brother of Abu ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ala’&gt; Khalid ibn Salamah al-Qurashi&gt;
Sa‘id ibn ‘Amr ibn Ja‘dah al-Makhzumi&gt; Ibn Abi Zurarah al-Ansari&gt; his father who related that the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, read this verse (Lo! the guilty are in error and
madness) and then said: “This verse was revealed about some future people from amongst this community
who will deny the Destiny of Allah, exalted is He”. Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Hiri informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn
Ya‘qub al-Ma‘qili&gt; Abu ‘Utbah Ahmad ibn al-Faraj&gt; Baqiyyah&gt; Ibn Thawban&gt; Bakir ibn Usayd&gt; his father
who said: “I was with Muhammad ibn Ka‘b when he said: ‘If you ever see me talk about Destiny, then tie
me up for I am then a madman. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, these verses have not been revealed
except about madmen’. Then he recited (Lo! the guilty are in error and madness… Lo! We have created
every thing by measure)”.</pre>
