<pre>[57:11] was revealed, a Jewish man in Medina by the name of Finhas
said: ‘Muhammad&#x27;s Lord is in need!’ When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab heard this, he got his sword and went
looking for him [to kill him]. Gabriel, peace be upon him, went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, and said to him: ‘Your Lord says to you (Tell those who believe to forgive those who
hope not for the days of Allah…)’. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Certainly, by Him
Who has sent you with the truth, anger will not show on my face!’ ”

(Those who spent and fought before the victory are not upon a level (with the rest of you)…)

[57:10].
Muhammad ibn Fudayl reported that al-Kalbi related that this verse was revealed about Abu Bakr al-Siddiq,
may Allah be well pleased with him. This is evidenced by the report which was related to us from
Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abdihi ibn Yahya&gt; Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd Allah alSaliti&gt; &#x27;Uthman ibn Sulayman al-Baghdadi&gt; Ya&#x27;qub ibn Ibrahim al-Makhzumi&gt; &#x27;Amr ibn Hafs al-Shaybani&gt;
al-&#x27;Ala&#x27; ibn &#x27;Amr&gt; Abu Ishaq al-Fazari&gt; Sufyan al-Thawri&gt; Adam ibn &#x27;Ali&gt; Ibn &#x27;Umar who said: “As the
Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting with Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, who was wearing a cloak
which he gathered round his chest with pins, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came down, conveyed Allah&#x27;s
greetings of peace to him and said: &#x27;O Muhammad, why is Abu Bakr wearing a cloak which he gathers round
his chest with pins?&#x27; He said: &#x27;O Gabriel, he has spent all his wealth before the conquest [of Mecca]!&#x27; He
said: &#x27;In that case, convey to him Allah&#x27;s greetings of peace, glorified and exalted is He, and tell him that
your Lord asks you: are you pleased with Me in your state of poverty or are you indignant?&#x27; The Prophet,
Allah bless him and give him peace, addressed Abu Bakr: &#x27;O Abu Bakr, Gabriel is here to convey the
greetings of peace of Allah, glorified and exalted is He, and He is asking you: are you pleased with Him in
your state of poverty or are you indignant?&#x27; Upon hearing this, Abu Bakr wept and said: &#x27;How can I be
indignant with my Lord? I am pleased with my Lord! I am pleased with my Lord!&#x27; ”

(Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe to submit to Allah’s reminder…)

[57:16]. Al-Kalbi
and Muqatil said: “This verse was revealed about the hypocrites, one year after Emigration. This is because
one day they asked Salman al-Farisi: ‘Tell us about what is in the Torah for it contains wonders’, and so this
verse was revealed”. Others said that this verse was revealed about the believers. ‘Abd al-Qahir ibn Tahir
informed us&gt; Abu ‘Amr ibn Matar&gt; Ja‘far ibn Muhammad al-Firyabi&gt; Ishaq ibn Rahwayh&gt; ‘Amr ibn
Muhammad al-Qurashi&gt; Khallad ibn Muslim al-Saffar&gt; ‘Amr ibn Qays al-Mula’i&gt; ‘Amr ibn Murrah&gt; Mus‘ab
ibn Sa‘d&gt; Sa‘d who said: “The Qur’an was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, and he recited it to them for a while. Then they said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, if only you narrate to us
[the events of old]’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (We narrate unto thee (O Muhammad) the best of
narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Qur’an)</pre>
