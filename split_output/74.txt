[75:3]
(Thinketh man that We shall not assemble his bones?)

[75:3]. This verse was revealed about ‘Adiyy ibn
Rabi‘ah. The latter went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: “Tell me about the
Day of Arising, when is it going to be? How is it going to be?” The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, answered his questions. Then ‘Adiyy said: “If I were to see that Day with my own eyes, I would not
accept what you say, O Muhammad, as true nor would I believe in you. Can Allah really assemble these
bones?” And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse.
