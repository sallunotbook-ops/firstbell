(Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope…)

[32:16]. Said Malik ibn Dinar: “I asked
Malik ibn Anas about whom this verse was revealed and he said: &#x27;Some of the Companions of the Prophet,
Allah bless him and give him peace, used to stand in prayer from after the prayer of Maghrib until the time
of the prayer of &#x27;Isha&#x27;, and so this verse was revealed about them&#x27; ”. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri&#x27; informed us&gt;
Abu&#x27;l-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Daynuri&gt; Musa ibn Muhammad&gt; al-Husayn ibn &#x27;Alawiyah&gt; Isma&#x27;il ibn &#x27;Isa&gt;
al-Musayyib&gt; Sa&#x27;id&gt;&gt; Qatadah&gt; Anas ibn Malik who said: “This verse (Who forsake their beds to cry unto
their Lord in fear and hope) was revealed about us, the Helpers. We used to perform the Maghrib prayer
and did not return to our homes until we performed the &#x27;Isha&#x27; prayer with the Prophet, Allah bless him and
give him peace”. Al-Hasan and Mujahid said: “This was revealed about those who keep the prayer of the
night vigil”. This is substantiated by the report with which Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn &#x27;Umar al-Khashshab
informed us&gt; Ibrahim ibn &#x27;Abd Allah al-Asfahani&gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Sarraj&gt; Qutaybah ibn Sa&#x27;id&gt;
Jarir&gt; al-A&#x27;mash&gt; al-Hakam&gt; Maymun&gt; Ibn Abi Shabib&gt; Mu&#x27;adh ibn Jabal who said: “While we were with
the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, at the Battle of Tabuk, suffering from the heat,
people dispersed. I looked around and found that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, was the closest person to me. I drew closer to him and asked: &#x27;O Messenger of Allah, tell me about a
deed which will cause me to enter the Garden and distance me from hellfire&#x27;. He said: &#x27;You have asked
about a great matter which is easy to do for whoever Allah, exalted is He, makes it easy: It is that you
worship Allah, exalted is He, and not associate anything with Him, perform the prescribed prayers, pay the
obligated poor-due, and fast the month of Ramadan. But if you will, I will inform you about all the doors of
goodness&#x27;. I said: &#x27;Do inform me, O Messenger of Allah!&#x27; He said: &#x27;Fasting is a shield; almsgiving expiates
sins, and the standing of a man in prayer in the middle of the night, seeking the countenance of Allah,
exalted is He&#x27;. Then he read this verse: (Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope)”.

[32:18]
(Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver?)

[32:18]. This verse was revealed about ‘Ali ibn
Abi Talib and al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Asfahani informed us&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn
Muhammad al-Hafiz&gt; Ishaq ibn Banan al-Anmati&gt; Hubaysh ibn Mubashshir al-Faqih&gt; ‘Ubayd Allah ibn
Musa&gt; Ibn Abi Layla&gt; al-Hakam&gt; Sa‘id ibn Jubayr&gt; Ibn ‘Abbas who said: “Al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi
Mu‘ayt said to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be well pleased with him: ‘I am tougher than you, more eloquent
than you, and I have more leadership skills than you’. ‘Ali responded by saying: ‘Be quiet, you are but an
evil-liver!’ This verse was then revealed (Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver? They are
not alike), by the believer is meant ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and the evil-liver refers to al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah”.</pre>
