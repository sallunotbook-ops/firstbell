<pre>[97:1-3]
(Lo! We revealed it on the Night of Predestination. Ah, what will convey unto thee what the Night of Power 
165
is! The Night of Power is better than a thousand months)

[97:1-3]. Abu Bakr al-Tamimi informed us&gt; ‘Abd
Allah ibn Hibban&gt; Abu Yahya al-Razi&gt; Sahl al-‘Askari&gt; Yahya ibn Abi Za’idah&gt; Muslim&gt; Ibn Abi Najih&gt;
Mujahid who said: “The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, mentioned an Israelite who carried
weapons and fought for the sake of Allah for a thousand months. The Muslims were astonished to hear this,
and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Lo! We revealed it on the Night of Predestination. Ah, what will convey
unto thee what the Night of Power is! The Night of Power is better than a thousand months). He said: ‘This
is better than the months in which that man carried his weapons and fought’ ”.</pre>
