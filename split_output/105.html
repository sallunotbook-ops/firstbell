<pre>[106:1-4]
(For the taming of Quraysh…) [1-4]. This Surah was revealed about the Quraysh and the blessings that
Allah, exalted is He, had bestowed upon them. The judge Abu Bakr al-Hiri informed us&gt; Abu Ja‘far ‘Abd
Allah ibn Isma‘il al-Hashimi&gt; Sawadah ibn ‘Ali&gt; Ahmad ibn Abu Bakr al-Zuhri&gt; Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn
Thabit&gt; ‘Uthman ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Atiq&gt; Sa‘id ibn ‘Amr ibn Ja‘dah&gt; his father&gt; his grandmother Umm
Hani’ bint Abi Talib who reported that the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “Allah has
favoured the Quraysh with seven characteristics which he has never given to anyone before them and will
never give to anyone after them: The post of the Caliph (al-Khilafah) is given to one among them, the
custody of the Sacred House (al-Hijabah) is assumed by someone from amongst them, giving water to the
pilgrims (al-Siqayah) during Hajj is undertaken by someone amongst them, prophethood is given to
someone amongst them, they were given victory over the [army of] elephants, they worshipped Allah for
seven years during which none worshipped Him, and a Surah has been revealed about them in which none
but them was mentioned (For the taming of Quraysh…)”.</pre>
