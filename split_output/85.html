<pre>[86:1-3]
(By the heaven and the Morning Star; ah, what will tell thee what the Morning Star is! The piercing Star!)

[86:1-3]. This was revealed about Abu Talib. He once went to visit the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him 
163
peace, and the latter offered him bread and milk. As Abu Talib was sitting and eating, a meteor fell, filling
everything with fire. Abu Talib was scared. He asked: “What on earth can this be?” The Prophet, Allah bless
him and give him peace, said: “This is a meteor that was thrown and it is one of the signs of Allah”. Abu
Talib was amazed, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed these verses.</pre>
