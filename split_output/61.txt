[62:11]
(But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it…)

[62:11]. Master Abu Tahir al-
155
Ziyadi informed us> Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Ibrahim> Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Warah> al-Hasan ibn
'Atiyyah> Isra'il> Husayn ibn 'Abd al-Rahman> Abu Sufyan> Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who said: “The Messenger
of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was standing, delivering a sermon one Friday, when a caravan
arrived from Syria. People left the mosque and went out to attend to it; only twelve people remained seated.
Allah, glorified and exalted is He, then revealed (But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they
break away to it and leave thee standing)”. This was narrated by Bukhari> Hafs ibn 'Umar> Khalid ibn 'Abd
Allah> Husayn. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Muzakki informed us> Abu Bakr ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yahya alTalhi> Ja'far ibn Ahmad ibn 'Imran al-Shashi> 'Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Yunus> 'Abthar ibn
al-Qasim> Husayn> Salim ibn Abi al-Ja'd> Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah: “It was Friday and we were with the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, when a caravan transporting food passed by.
Except for twelve men, everyone left to attend to it, and so the verse of Friday (Ayat al-Jumu'ah) was
revealed”. This was narrated by Muslim> Ishaq ibn Ibrahim> Jarir and also by al-Bukhari in Kitab alJumu'ah> Mu'awiyah ibn 'Amr> Za'idah; both Jariri and Ibn Za'idah related it from Husayn. The
commentators of the Qur'an said: “The people of Medina were suffering from hunger and a rise in prices.
And it happened that Dihyah ibn Khalifah al-Kalbi arrived from a business trip to Syria. His arrival was
announced to people by beating a drum while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
was standing, delivering the Friday sermon. People left the mosque such that only twelve people remained
inside, including Abu Bakr and 'Umar. This verse was then revealed, and the Prophet, Allah bless him and
give him peace, said: 'By Him in Whose Hand is Muhammad's soul, had you followed each other, such that
none of you remained, the valley would have inundated you with fire' ”.
