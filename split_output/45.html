<pre>[46:15]”. Abu Sa‘id informed us&gt; Abu Bakr al-Ghazi&gt; Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn
Hamdan&gt; Abu Ya‘la&gt; Abu Khaythamah&gt; al-Hasan ibn Musa&gt; Zuhayr&gt; Simak ibn Harb&gt; Mus‘ab ibn Sa‘d ibn
Abi Waqqas&gt; his father who said: “This verse was revealed about me. Umm Sa‘d [his mother] swore that
she will never speak to me, eat or drink, until I disbelieve in Islam. She did this for three days until she
passed out from exhaustion. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (We have enjoined on man kindness to
parents…)”. This was narrated by Muslim from Abu Khaythamah.

[46:9]
(…nor know I what will be done with me or with you…)

[46:9]. Al-Kalbi reported from Abu Salih that Ibn
‘Abbas said: “When tribulations faced by the Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, intensified, The Prophet saw in his dream that he migrated to a land that had palms, trees and plenty
of water. He related this dream to his Companions and the latter took it for a good omen and a harbinger of
relief from the harm of the idolaters which they faced. After a while, when they saw that nothing had
happened, they said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! When are you going to migrate to the land which you saw in
your dream?’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not answer them, but Allah,
exalted is He, revealed (…nor know I what will be done with me or with you…), i.e. I do not know whether
or not I am going to move to the place which I saw in my dream. I follow only that which is revealed to
me”.

[46:15]
(…till, when he attaineth full strength and reacheth forty years…)

[46:15]. &#x27;Ata&#x27; reported that Ibn &#x27;Abbas
said: “This verse was revealed about Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be well pleased with him. He had
travelled with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace - when he was eighteen years old
and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was twenty - to Syria for trade. When they
reached a place where there was a lotus tree, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
sat under the shade of this tree while Abu Bakr went to a monk nearby to ask him about religion. The monk
then asked Abu Bakr: &#x27;Who is that man under the shade of the lotus?&#x27; Abu Bakr said: &#x27;He is Muhammad ibn
&#x27;Abd Allah ibn &#x27;Abd al-Muttalib&#x27;. The monk said: &#x27;By Allah, he is a Prophet. No one sat under the shade of this
tree after Jesus, son of Mary, except Muhammad the Prophet of Allah&#x27;. At that moment, certainty and faith
entered Abu Bakr&#x27;s heart. He accompanied the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
everywhere whether in travel or in Mecca. When The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, was sent as a Prophet at the age of forty, Abu Bakr who was then thirty-eight embraced Islam and
believed in the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. When Abu Bakr reached forty, he
prayed (My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for the favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me…)”.

[46:9] were revealed, the Jews
insulted the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and the Muslims, saying: ‘How will we follow a
man who says that he does not know what will be done with him?’ The Prophet, Allah bless him and give
him peace, was aggrieved by what they said, and Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed (Lo! We have
given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory that Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that 
138
which is to come…)</pre>
