(Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send before them, and their footprints…)

[36:12]. Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri said: “The Banu Salamah were settled at one extremity of Medina and wanted
to move closer to the mosque [of the Prophet]. This verse was then revealed (Lo! We it is Who bring the
dead to life. We record that which they send before them, and their footprints…), and so the Prophet, Allah
bless him and give him peace, said to them: ‘Your footprints are recorded, why then do you want to move?’
” The prophetic descendent Isma‘il ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan Tabari informed us> his
grandfather> ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sharqi> ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Bishr> ‘Abd al-Razzaq> alThawri> Sa‘id ibn Turayf> Abu Nadrah> Abu Sa‘id who said: “The Banu Salamah complained to the
Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, about the remoteness of their homes from the mosque.
Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (We record that which they send before them…) upon which the Prophet,
Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Do not move from your homes. Your footprints are recorded for
you in your favour’ ”.

(Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away?)

[36:78]. The commentators of the Qur’an said:
“Ubayy ibn Khalaf went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, with a decayed bone and said to
him: ‘O Muhammad, do you think that Allah will bring back to life this decayed bone?’ He said: ‘Yes, He will,
and He will also resurrect you and cast you in hellfire’. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed these verses (And 
133
he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his creation, saying: Who will revive these
bones when they have rotted away?...)

Malik who said: “Ubayy ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, with a decayed bone which he crushed in his hand and then said: ‘O Muhammad, will Allah resurrect
this now that it has become dust?’ He said: ‘Yes, Allah will resurrect it; he will also make you die, bring you
back to life and then cast you in the fire of Gehenna’. This verse was then revealed”.
