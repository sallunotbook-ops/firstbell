[57:11] was revealed, a Jewish man in Medina by the name of Finhas
said: ‘Muhammad's Lord is in need!’ When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab heard this, he got his sword and went
looking for him [to kill him]. Gabriel, peace be upon him, went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, and said to him: ‘Your Lord says to you (Tell those who believe to forgive those who
hope not for the days of Allah…)’. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Certainly, by Him
Who has sent you with the truth, anger will not show on my face!’ ”

Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, was sitting with Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, who was wearing a cloak
which he gathered round his chest with pins, Gabriel, peace be upon him, came down, conveyed Allah's
greetings of peace to him and said: 'O Muhammad, why is Abu Bakr wearing a cloak which he gathers round
his chest with pins?' He said: 'O Gabriel, he has spent all his wealth before the conquest [of Mecca]!' He
said: 'In that case, convey to him Allah's greetings of peace, glorified and exalted is He, and tell him that
your Lord asks you: are you pleased with Me in your state of poverty or are you indignant?' The Prophet,
Allah bless him and give him peace, addressed Abu Bakr: 'O Abu Bakr, Gabriel is here to convey the
greetings of peace of Allah, glorified and exalted is He, and He is asking you: are you pleased with Him in
your state of poverty or are you indignant?' Upon hearing this, Abu Bakr wept and said: 'How can I be
indignant with my Lord? I am pleased with my Lord! I am pleased with my Lord!' ”

peace, and he recited it to them for a while. Then they said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, if only you narrate to us
[the events of old]’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (We narrate unto thee (O Muhammad) the best of
narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Qur’an)
