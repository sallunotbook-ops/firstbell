Hani’ bint Abi Talib who reported that the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “Allah has
favoured the Quraysh with seven characteristics which he has never given to anyone before them and will
never give to anyone after them: The post of the Caliph (al-Khilafah) is given to one among them, the
custody of the Sacred House (al-Hijabah) is assumed by someone from amongst them, giving water to the
pilgrims (al-Siqayah) during Hajj is undertaken by someone amongst them, prophethood is given to
someone amongst them, they were given victory over the [army of] elephants, they worshipped Allah for
seven years during which none worshipped Him, and a Surah has been revealed about them in which none
but them was mentioned (For the taming of Quraysh…)”.
