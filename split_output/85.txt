[86:1-3]
(By the heaven and the Morning Star; ah, what will tell thee what the Morning Star is! The piercing Star!)

peace, and the latter offered him bread and milk. As Abu Talib was sitting and eating, a meteor fell, filling
everything with fire. Abu Talib was scared. He asked: “What on earth can this be?” The Prophet, Allah bless
him and give him peace, said: “This is a meteor that was thrown and it is one of the signs of Allah”. Abu
Talib was amazed, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed these verses.
