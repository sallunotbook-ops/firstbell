[68:4]
(And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature)

[68:4]. Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us> ‘Abd Allah ibn
Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Hayyan> Ahmad ibn Ja‘far> ibn Nasr al-Jamal> Jarir ibn Yahya> Husayn ibn
‘Ulwan al-Kufi> Hisham ibn ‘Urwah> his father> ‘A’ishah who said: “No one had a better character than the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. Never did anyone among his Companions, or
household, call him except that he said: ‘I am at your service!’ this is why Allah, glorious and majestic is He,
revealed (And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature)”.

[68:51]
(And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee…)

[68:51]. This verse was revealed when the 
160
disbelievers wanted to give the evil eye to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. Some
people from the Quraysh looked once at him and said: “We have never seen anyone like him or like his
proofs”. The Banu Asad were renowned for their evil eye. A fat camel or cow would pass by one of them
and, after giving it the evil eye, he would say to his slave-girl: “O girl, take a large basket and a silver coin
and bring us some of the meat of this!” The camel or cow would fall dead straight after that and would then
be hamstrung. Said al-Kalbi: “There was a man from the Arabs who used to abstain from food for two or
three days and then raise part of his tent, upon the passing by of cattle, and say: ‘There are no grazing
camels or sheep today better than these’, and the cattle would not proceed far before some of them would
fall dead. The disbelievers requested this man to give the evil eye to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, but Allah, exalted is He, protected His Prophet and revealed this verse”.
