[50:38]
(And verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of
weariness touched Us)

[50:38]. Al-Hasan and Qatadah said: “The Jews said: ‘Allah created the creation in
six days and rested on the seventh, Saturday’, which they call the Sabbath, and so Allah, exalted is He,
revealed this verse”. Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tamimi informed us> ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja‘far alHafiz> Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan> Hannad ibn al-Sari> Abu Bakr ibn ‘Ayyash> Abu Sa‘d alBaqqal> ‘Ikrimah> Ibn ‘Abbas who said: “The Jews came to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, and asked him about the creation of the heavens and earth. He said to them: ‘Allah created the earth
on Sunday and Monday; He created the mountains [and what they contain of benefits] on Tuesday; He
created the trees and water on Wednesday; He created heaven on Thursday; on Friday, He created the
stars, sun and moon’. ‘And what after that, O Muhammad?’ the Jews asked. He said: ‘Then, He established
Himself on the Throne’. They said: ‘You would have answered correctly, if you added: and then He rested’.
The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was furious. This verse was then revealed (And
verily We created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six Days, and naught of
weariness touched Us. Therefor (O Muhammad) bear with what they say)
