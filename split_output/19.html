<pre>[20:1-2]
(Ta. Ha. We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur&#x27;an that thou shouldst be distressed)

[20:1-
2]. Muqatil said: “Abu Jahl and al-Nadr ibn al-Harith said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace:
&#x27;You have become distressed because of leaving our religion&#x27;. They said this because they saw him
immersed in worship for long times and striving hard. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. Abu
Bakr al-Harithi informed us&gt; Abu&#x27;l-Shaykh al-Hafiz&gt; Abu Yahya&gt; al-&#x27;Askari&gt; Abu Malik&gt; Juwaybir&gt; alDahhak who said: “When the Qur&#x27;an was revealed to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, he
and his Companions stood up to pray. The unbelievers of Quraysh said: &#x27;This Qur&#x27;an was only revealed to
Muhammad to make him distressed&#x27;. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Ta. Ha), He says: O man (We
have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur&#x27;an that thou shouldst be distressed)”.

[20:131]
(And strain not thine eyes…)

[20:131]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Tha‘labi informed us&gt; Shu‘ayb
ibn Muhammad al-Bayhaqi&gt; Makki ibn ‘Abdan&gt; Abu’l-Azhar&gt; Rawh&gt; Musa ibn ‘Ubaydah al-Rabdhi&gt; Yazid
ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Qusayt&gt; Abu Rafi‘, the client of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, who reported that a guest dropped by the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
and so he summoned me and asked me to go to a Jewish man who sold food. He entrusted me to tell him:
“Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, has received a guest and does not
have what to offer him for food. Could you sell me such-and-such measure of ground wheat or lend me
some food which I will repay at the appearance of the moon of Rajab”. The Jew said: “I will not sell him or
lend him except in exchange for a security”. I went back to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace,
and when I repeated what the Jew had said, he exclaimed: “By Allah, I am trustworthy in heaven as I am
trustworthy on earth. Had he sold to me or lent me, I would have paid back. Take my armour as security”.
This verse was revealed to consol him about this world (And strain not thine eyes toward that which We
cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy, the flower of the life of the world, that We may try them
thereby…).</pre>
