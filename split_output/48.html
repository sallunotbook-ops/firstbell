(O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger, and keep your duty to
Allah…)

[49:1]. Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim informed us&gt; ‘Ubayd Allah ibn Muhammad al-
‘Ukbari&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Baghawi&gt; al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sabah&gt; Hajjaj ibn
Muhammad&gt; Ibn Jurayj&gt; Ibn Abi Mulaykah&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr who relate that horsemen from the
Banu Tamim went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so Abu Bakr said:
“Appoint al-Qa‘qa‘ ibn Ma‘bad as their leader”, ‘Umar, on the other hand, said: “No, appoint al-Aqra‘ ibn
Habis as their leader!” Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar: “You just want to oppose me!” ‘Umar said: “I do not want to
oppose you”, and they argued to the extent that they raised their voices on each other. About this incident,
these words of Allah, exalted is He, were revealed: (O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of
Allah and His messenger…) up to His words, glorified is He, (And if they had had patience till thou camest
forth unto them, it had been better for them…)

[49:5]. This was narrated by Bukhari from al-Hasan ibn
Muhammad ibn al-Sabah.

[49:2]
(O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet…)

[49:2]. This verse was revealed
about Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas who was hard of hearing and loud. When he spoke with a person he
always raised his voice. He might have annoyed the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
with his loud voice when he spoke to him. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. Ahmad ibn
Ibrahim al-Muzakki informed us&gt; ‘Ubayd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Zahid&gt; Abu’l-Qasim al-Baghawi&gt; Qatan
ibn Nusayr&gt; Ja‘far ibn Sulayman al-Dab‘i&gt; Thabit&gt; Anas who said: “When this verse (O ye who believe! Lift
not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet) was revealed, Thabit ibn Qays said: ‘I am the one who
used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace; I am therefore of
the inhabitants of hellfire’. This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, and he said: ‘He is rather of the people of the Garden’ ”. This was narrated by Muslim from Qatan ibn
Nusayr. Ibn Abi Mulaykah said: “The best ones, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, did almost perish. They raised their
voices in the presence of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, when some horsemen from the
Banu Tamim came to see him. One of them suggested al-Aqra‘ ibn Habis [for the leadership of Banu Tamim]
while the other suggested another man. Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar: ‘You only wanted to oppose me!’ ‘Umar
responded: ‘I did not want to oppose you’, and they raised their voices while arguing with each other. Allah,
exalted is He, revealed about this (O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the
Prophet…)”. Ibn al-Zubayr said: “After this verse was revealed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, could hardly hear what ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said to him; he had to ask again about what he
said”.

[49:3]
(Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah…)

[49:3]. ‘Ata’ reported that
Ibn ‘Abbas said: “When the words of Allah (Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet) were
revealed, Abu Bakr vowed not to address the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
except in whisper. Allah, exalted is He, revealed about Abu Bakr (Lo! they who subdue their voices in the
presence of the messenger of Allah…)”. Abu Bakr al-Qadi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn Ya‘qub&gt; Muhammad
ibn Ishaq al-Saghani&gt; Yahya ibn ‘Abd al-Hamid&gt; Husayn ibn ‘Umar al-Ahmasi&gt; Mukhariq&gt; Tariq&gt; Abu Bakr
who said: “When the verse (Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah,
those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness) was revealed, Abu Bakr said: ‘I vowed
not to address the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, except in whisper’ ”.

[49:4]
(Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them have no sense)

[49:4]. Ahmad
ibn &#x27;Ubayd Allah al-Makhladi informed us&gt; Abu Muhammad &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Daqqaq&gt;
Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Khuzaymah&gt; Muhammad ibn Yahya al-&#x27;Ataki&gt; al-Mu&#x27;tamir ibn Sulayman&gt; Dawud
al-Tafawi&gt; Abu Muslim al-Bajali&gt; Zayd ibn Arqam who said: “Some people went to see the Prophet, Allah
bless him and give him peace, and found him in his private apartment, so they started calling him: &#x27;O
Muhammad! O Muhammad!&#x27; Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Lo! those who call thee from behind the
private apartments, most of them have no sense)”. Muhammad ibn Ishaq and others said: “This verse was
revealed about some uncouth people from Banu Tamim. A delegation of the Banu Tamim went to see the
Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. They entered the mosque and called the Prophet, Allah bless
him and give him peace, who was in his private apartment: &#x27;O Muhammad, come out to meet us, for our
praise is nice while our censure is nasty&#x27;. Their shouting annoyed the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, and so he came out to see them. They said: &#x27;O Muhammad, we have come to brag to you&#x27;. Allah,
exalted is He, revealed about them (Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of
them have no sense). Among these people were al-Aqra&#x27; ibn Habis, &#x27;Uyaynah ibn Hisn, al-Zibriqan ibn Badr
and Qays ibn &#x27;Asim”. This incident of bragging was related to us by Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad alMuqri&#x27;&gt; al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Sadusi&gt; al-Hasan ibn Salih ibn Hani&#x27;&gt; al-Fadl ibn
Muhammad ibn al-Musayyab&gt; al-Qasim ibn Abi Shaybah&gt; Mu&#x27;alla ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman&gt; &#x27;Abd al-Hamid ibn
Ja&#x27;far&gt; &#x27;Umar ibn al-Hakam&gt; Jabir ibn &#x27;Abd Allah who said: “A delegation from Banu Tamim came to see the
Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. They called him from outside his doorstep: &#x27;O Muhammad,
come out to meet us, for our praise is nice while our censure is nasty&#x27;. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give 
140
him peace, heard them and came out, saying: &#x27;Indeed, it is only Allah whose praise is nice and censure
nasty&#x27;. They said: &#x27;We are people from Banu Tamim; we have brought our poet and our orator to show you
our excellence over you in poetry and brag about our merits&#x27;. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, said: &#x27;I was not sent with poetry nor was I commanded to brag. But let us see what you
have!&#x27; al-Zibriqan ibn Badr said to one of their youths: &#x27;Stand up and mention your merit and the merit of
your people&#x27;. The youth stood up and said: &#x27;Praise be to Allah Who has made us the best of His created
beings; He gave us riches with which we do as we please. We are, therefore, of the best among the
inhabitants of the earth and of those who have more means, wealth and arms. Whoever denies what we
have said, let him say words better than our words and mention works better than ours&#x27;. The Messenger of
Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas: &#x27;Stand and respond to him!&#x27;
Thabit stood up and said: &#x27;Praise be to Allah; I praise Him and seek His assistance; I believe in Him and in
Him I fully trust. I bear witness that there is no deity except Allah, alone without any partners, and I bear
witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger who called the Emigrants amongst his cousins - who are
endowed with the most beautiful faces and the greatest intelligences - and they followed him. So praise be
to Allah Who made us the helpers and aids of His Messenger and a cause for the triumph of His religion. We
therefore fight people until they bear witness that there is no deity except Allah. Whoever utters the
expression of faith renders his own person and wealth inviolable as far as we are concerned. But whoever
rejects faith, we kill him and killing him for the sake of Allah, exalted is He, would indeed be easy for us. I
say these words of mine and seek Allah&#x27;s forgiveness for the believing men and women&#x27;. Al-Zibriqan ibn
Badr then addressed one of their youths, saying: &#x27;Stand up, O so-and-so, and say some poetry in which you
mention your merit and the merit if your people&#x27;. A youth stood up and said: We are the nobles, no tribe is
our equal The leaders are amongst us and the fourth of all booties is given to us. In time of drought we feed
all people From the thin clouds of Autumn when wind-driven clouds fail to show. If we scorn, none can
stand up to us Thus upon boasting do we rise. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
sent for Hassan ibn Thabit and when the emissary reached him, Hassan said: &#x27;What does he want, I was
with him just a while ago?&#x27; The emissary said: &#x27;Banu Tamim brought their poet and orator and the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded Thabit ibn Qays to respond to their
orator, and he has sent for you to respond to their poet&#x27;. When Hassan arrived, the Messenger of Allah,
Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded him to respond to their poet. Hassan said: &#x27;O Messenger of
Allah, ask him to repeat what he composed&#x27;. When the poetry was repeated to him, he said: We supported
Allah&#x27;s Messenger and religion by force In spite of the enemy of the desert and settlements. Do we not
embrace death in the turmoil of battle When the resort of death becomes sweet among armies. And we
strike the heads of armoured fighters as we belong To a lineage from the root of the mighty Ghassan. If it
were not for diffidence toward Allah we would say, displaying our nobleness to people, at the base of the
two mountains, is there any who would like to fight. Our living ones are of the best of those who have set
foot on the ground And our dead are the best inhabitants of the graveyards. At this point al-Aqra&#x27; ibn Habis
stood up and said: &#x27;By Allah, I have come for something other than that which these people have come for.
I have composed some poetry, so hear it!&#x27; He said: &#x27;Let us hear it&#x27;. Al-Aqra&#x27; said: To you we have come so
that people recognise our merit When they boast to us upon mentioning noble traits. We are the leaders of
people at any company In the land of Hijaz there is nothing like Darim. In every single raid we have a fourth
of the booty Whether the raid is in Najd or the land of al-Taha&#x27;im. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, said: &#x27;Stand up, O Hassan, and respond to him&#x27;. Hassan stood up and said: Banu Darim,
do not boast, for your boasting Turns to your disadvantage upon mentioning noble traits. You lost your
minds when you boasted to us when you are Our chattels, some of you wet nurses and some servants. The
best glory and high rank you could ever get Is to come next to us upon mentioning those who are nobler. If
you have come to spare your lives And wealth and share what is to be shared, Then ascribe not an equal to
Allah and embrace Islam And do not boast to the Prophet about Darim. Otherwise, by the Lord of the
House, our hands will strike Your necks with sharp swords. Al-Aqra&#x27; ibn Habis said: &#x27;Indeed, Muhammad is
assisted; I do not know what this matter is. Their orator spoke better than ours and their poet composed
better poetry than that of our poet&#x27;. Al-Aqra&#x27; then drew closer to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, and said: &#x27;I bear witness that that there is no deity except Allah and that you are the
Messenger of Allah&#x27;, upon which the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: &#x27;Whatever
happened before will not harm you!&#x27; The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, gave them
gifts and clothed them. Voices were raised and much clamour ensued before the Messenger of Allah, Allah
bless him and give him peace. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed these verses (Lift not up your voices
above the voice of the Prophet…) up to His words (… and immense reward)”.

[49:6-8]
(O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it…)

[49:6-8]. These verse were revealed about
al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ayt. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent him to
collect the poor-due from Banu’l-Mustaliq. However, there was an old enmity between him and them in the
pre-Islamic period. When these people heard of his coming, they came out to receive him out of reverence
for Allah, exalted is He, and His Messenger. But he was scared of them and the devil whispered to him that
they wanted to kill him. He returned halfway and went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give
him peace, saying: “Banu’l-Mustaliq have refused to pay the poor-due and wanted to kill me”. The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, became angry and was about to attack them.
Meanwhile, when Banu’l-Mustaliq realised that the emissary had gone back, they went to the Messenger of
Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: “We heard of your emissary and we went out to receive
him, honour him and give him that which was due upon us of the right of Allah, exalted is He. But your
emissary went back and we feared that what sent him back might be a message he received from you
because you are angry with us. And we seek refuge in Allah from His wrath and from the wrath of His
Messenger”. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (O ye who believe! If an evil-liver) i.e. al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah
(bring you tidings, verify it…). Al-Hakim Abu ‘Abd Allah al-Shadhyakhi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abd
Allah ibn Zakariyya al-Shaybani&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Daghuli&gt; Sa‘id ibn Mas‘ud&gt; Muhammad
ibn Sabiq&gt; ‘Isa ibn Dinar&gt; his father&gt; al-Harith ibn Dirar who said: “I went to see the Messenger of Allah,
Allah bless him and give him peace, and he invited me to embrace Islam. I embraced Islam and believed. He
enjoined me to pay the poor-due and I agreed. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I will go to my people and
invite them to embrace Islam and pay the poor-due. I will collect the poor-due from whoever accepts my
invitation and at such-and-such a time you send for me so that I bring you the poor-due I collect’ ”. When
al-Harith ibn Dirar collected the poor-due from those who accepted to embrace Islam and it was the agreed
time for sending it to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, the emissary failed to
show. Al-Harith thought that Allah and His Messenger were angry with him. He gathered the leaders of his
people and said to them: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, has set a specific
time for me to send an emissary to collect the poor-due that I have with me. The Messenger of Allah, Allah
bless him and give him peace, does not go back on his word. I think that the emissary has failed to show up
because of anger. Let us go to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace”. The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had sent al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah to al-Harith to fetch
the poor-due that the latter had collected. After travelling a while, al-Walid got scared and returned back. He
said: “O Messenger of Allah, al-Harith refused to hand the poor-due over to me and wanted to kill me”. The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a dispatch to al-Harith and met al-Harith and
his companions who were coming to see the Prophet close to Medina. Al-Harith met them there and they
recognized him. He asked them: “To whom have you been sent?” They said: “To you”. “Why?” he asked.
They said: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent you al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah but he
came back claiming that you refused to give him the poor-due and that you wanted to kill him”. He said:
“No, by Him Who has sent Muhammad with the truth; I did not see him nor did he come to me”. When alHarith entered in on the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, he said to him: “You
withheld the poor-due and wanted to kill my emissary!” Al-Harith said: “No, by Him Who has sent
Muhammad with the truth; I did not see your emissary nor did he come to me. I only came when your
emissary failed to show up and I feared that Allah and His Messenger might be angry with us”. Then these
verses of al-Hujurat were revealed (O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye smite
some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did) up to His words ((It is) a bounty and a grace
from Allah; and Allah is Knower, Wise)

[49:8].

[49:9]
(And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them…)

[49:9]. Muhammad ibn
Ahmad ibn Ja‘far al-Nahwi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Sinan al-Muqri’&gt; Ahmad ibn ‘Ali alMawsili&gt; Ishaq ibn Abi Isra’il&gt; Mu‘tamir ibn Sulayman&gt; his father&gt; Anas who related: “I said: ‘O Prophet of
Allah, why do you not visit ‘Abd Allah ibn Ubayy?’ The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, decided
to go and visit him. He mounted an ass and the Muslims walked with him. It happened that the ground was
full of manure. So when the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, reached ‘Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, the 
142
latter said: ‘Keep away from me, the staunch of your ass is offending me’. A man from the Helpers said to
him: ‘By Allah, the ass of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, smells better than
you’. One of the men of ‘Abd Allah ibn Ubayy got angry; then the men of both parties became angry
because of what was said. They exchanged blows and hurled leafless palm leaves and sandals at each
others. We heard that it is about them that (And if two parties of believers fall to fighting…) was revealed”.
This was narrated by Bukhari from Musaddid and by Muslim from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la; both
Musaddid and Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-A‘la related it from al-Mu‘tamir.

[49:11]
(O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they (are)…)

[49:11]. This was
revealed about Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas. The latter was hard of hearing and when he came to see the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, the Companions made room for him in order for
him to sit next to the Prophet so that he could hear him. He came one day when people were already seated
and started stepping over people, saying: “Make room! Make room!” One man said to him: “You have found
a place, so sit down!” Thabit sat down but he was angry. He tried to tease the man. He said: “Who are
you?” The man said: “So-and-so”. Thabit exclaimed: “What, the son of so-and-so”, and he mentioned his
mother about whom they used to taunt him in the pre-Islamic period. The man lowered his head out of
embarrassment. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. (… not let women (deride) women who may
be better than they are)

[49:11]. This was revealed about two of the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him
and give him peace, who derided Umm Salamah. What happened is that the latter tied her loins with a white
dress and spread its extremity behind her such that she dragged it behind her. ‘A’ishah said to Hafsah:
“Look at what she is dragging behind her! It looks like a dog’s tongue”. This was their derision of her. Anas
said: “This was revealed about the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, who made fun
of Umm Salamah because she was short. ‘Ikrimah reported that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “Safiyyah bint Huyayy ibn
Akhtab went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah,
women revile me, saying: O Jewess, daughter of Jewish parents!’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, said to her: ‘Could you not have said to them in reply: my father is Aaron, my uncle is
Moses and my husband is Muhammad’. Then, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. (…nor insult one
another by nicknames…)

[49:11]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mihrajani informed us&gt; Abu ‘Abd
Allah ibn Battah&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz&gt; Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Marwazi&gt; Hafs ibn
Ghiyath&gt; Dawud ibn Abi Hind&gt; al-Sha‘bi&gt; Abu Jubayrah ibn al-Dahhak&gt; his father and uncles who said:
“The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, came to us and, when some men used nicknames to call
others, it was said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, those who are called by these nicknames do not like it’. This verse
was then revealed (…nor insult one another by nicknames…)”.

[49:13]
(O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female…)

[49:13]. Said Ibn &#x27;Abbas: “This was revealed
about Thabit ibn Qays when he made a remark about the man who did not make room for him to sit: &#x27;What,
the son of so-and-so [referring to his mother]&#x27;. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,
said: &#x27;Who mentioned that woman?&#x27; Thabit stood up and said: &#x27;I did, O Messenger of Allah!&#x27; The Messenger
said to him: &#x27;Look at the faces of those present&#x27;. And when he looked, he asked him: &#x27;What do you see?&#x27; He
said: &#x27;I see white, red and black people&#x27;. The Prophet said: &#x27;Well, you are not better than any of them unless
it be through [the good practice of] religion and God-fearingness&#x27;. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this
verse”. Muqatil said: “On the day Mecca was conquered, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give
him peace, ordered Bilal to climb on the roof of the Ka&#x27;bah and perform the call to prayer. &#x27;Attab ibn Asid
commented on this: &#x27;Praise be to Allah, that Allah has taken my father to Him and made that he did not see
this day&#x27;. Al-Harith ibn Hisham said: &#x27;Did Muhammad not find any other caller to prayer except this black
raven?&#x27; Suhayl ibn &#x27;Amr said: &#x27;Allah willing, he will change him&#x27;. Abu Sufyan, on the other hand, said: &#x27;I am
not going to make any comment; I am afraid that the Lord of heaven will divulge what I say!&#x27; Gabriel, peace
be upon him, went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and informed him about what they
said. The Prophet summoned them and asked them about what they said and they admitted it. Allah,
exalted is He, then revealed this verse warning them against boasting about their lineages and abundance of
wealth and against looking down on the poor”. Abu Hassan al-Muzakki informed us&gt; Harun ibn Muhammad
al-Istrabadhi&gt; Abu Muhammad Ishaq ibn Muhammad al-Khuza&#x27;i&gt; Abu&#x27;l-Walid al-Azraqi&gt; his grandfather&gt; 
143
&#x27;Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Ward al-Makki&gt; Ibn Abi Mulaykah who said: “On the day Mecca was conquered, Bilal
climbed on the roof of the Ka&#x27;bah and performed the call to prayer. One person said: &#x27;O servants of Allah!
How can this black slave be allowed to perform the call to prayer on top of the Ka&#x27;bah?&#x27; Another man said:
&#x27;If Allah is displeased, He will change him&#x27;. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse (O mankind! Lo! We
have created you male and female)”. Yazid ibn Shajarah said: “One day, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless
him and give him peace, passed by some of the marketplaces of Medina and saw a black slave standing
while his seller was crying: &#x27;This is for sale for whoever wants to offer more!&#x27; The slave kept repeating: &#x27;I
have a condition for whoever wants to buy me&#x27;. He was asked: &#x27;What is your condition?&#x27; He said: &#x27;He should
not stop me from performing the five prescribed prayers behind the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace&#x27;. A man bought him on this condition. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, saw him at each prescribed prayer until he failed to see him one day. He asked his owner: &#x27;Where is
the slave boy?&#x27; He said: &#x27;He has fever, O Messenger of Allah!&#x27; The Prophet said to his Companions: &#x27;Let us
go and visit him&#x27;. They went and visited him. After a few days, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, asked his owner: &#x27;How is the slave boy?&#x27; The man said: &#x27;O Messenger of Allah, the boy&#x27;s lips have
turned dark&#x27;. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went and entered in on the boy. He found
him feverish and he died in that state. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, took
charge of his washing, shrouding and burial. His Companions were horrified and became greatly disturbed.
The Emigrants said: &#x27;We have left our homes, wealth and family, but none of us has seen in his life, sickness
or death what this slave boy has&#x27;. The Helpers said: &#x27;We have received him in our homes, helped him and
consoled him with our riches but he preferred this Abyssinian slave over us&#x27;. Allah, glorious and majestic is
He, then revealed this verse (O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female), i.e. you are the
children of one father and one mother, and He showed them the merit of God-fearingness by His words (Lo!
the noblest of you, in the sight of Allah…)”.

[49:14]
(The wandering Arabs say: We believe…)

[49:14]. This was revealed about some desert Arabs from Banu
Asad ibn Khuzaymah. They went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, in Medina
because there was drought in that year. They declared themselves to be believers outwardly but disbelievers
inwardly. They sullied the streets of Medina with excrement and caused a rise in its prices. They used to say
to the Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace: “We have come to you with loads and dependents
and refrained to fight against you unlike such-and-such a tribe, so give us alms”. They kept mentioning to
him the favours they thought they had done. Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse about them.</pre>
