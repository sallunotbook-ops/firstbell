[70:1]
(A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall)

[70:1]. This verse was revealed about al-Nadr
ibn al-Harith when he said [as reported in the Qur’an] (O Allah! if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then
rain down stones on us or bring on us some painful doom!)

[70:38-39]
(Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight? Nay…)

[70:38-39]. The commentators
of the Qur’an said: “The idolaters used to gather round the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to
listen to him but did not benefit from him. Instead, they gave him the lie and mocked him. They said: ‘If
these were to enter Paradise, we shall certainly enter it before them, and we will have more wealth therein
than they will ever have’. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”.
