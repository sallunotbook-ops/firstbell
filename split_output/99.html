(By the snorting courses…)

[100:1-11]. Muqatil said: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, sent a military expedition to a clan of Banu Kinanah and appointed al-Mundhir ibn ‘Amr al-Ansari as
its leader. When their news was late to come, the hypocrites said: ‘They have all been killed’, and so Allah,
exalted is He, gave news about this expedition and revealed (By the snorting courses) meaning the horses
of that expedition”. ‘Abd al-Ghafir ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us&gt; Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Basti&gt;
Muhammad ibn Makki&gt; Ishaq ibn Ibrahim&gt; Ahmad ibn ‘Abdah&gt; Hafs ibn Jami‘&gt; Simak&gt; ‘Ikrimah&gt; Ibn
‘Abbas who related that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a cavalry in a
mission but did not receive any news from them a month after they had left. And so it was revealed (By the
snorting courses) i.e. the horses snorting with their nostrils.</pre>
