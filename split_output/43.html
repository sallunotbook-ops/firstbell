(… Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!)

[44:49]. Qatadah said: “This verse was revealed
about the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, who protested: ‘Is Muhammad threatening me? By Allah, I am the
mightiest man between its two mountains [Mecca’s two mountains]’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed
this verse”. Abu Bakr al-Harithi informed us&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Hayyan&gt; Abu Yahya al-Razi&gt;
Sahl ibn ‘Uthman&gt; Asbat&gt; Abu Bakr al-Hudhali&gt; ‘Ikrimah who said: “One day, the Prophet, Allah bless him
and give him peace, met Abu Jahl. The latter said to him: ‘You know that I am of the most powerful people
on earth, and that I am the mighty, the noble!’ Allah, exalted is He, killed him at the Battle of Badr,
humiliated him and reviled him, using his own words. This verse was revealed about him (Taste! Lo! thou
wast forsooth the mighty, the noble!)”.</pre>
