(Lo! thou (O Muhammad) guidest not whom thou lovest…)

[28:56]. Abu &#x27;Abd Allah Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd
Allah al-Shirazi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Khamrawayh&gt; &#x27;Ali ibn
Muhammad al-Khuza&#x27;i&gt; Abu&#x27;l-Yaman al-Hakam ibn Nafi&#x27;&gt; Shu&#x27;ayb&gt; al-Zuhri&gt; Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyab&gt; his
father who said: “When death was about to overtake Abu Talib, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, went to see him and there he found with him Abu Jahl and &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah. The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, addressed his uncle: &#x27;O uncle, say, there is no deity
save Allah, and I will argue, by means of it, in your favour with Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He&#x27;. Abu Jahl
and &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah said: &#x27;O Abu Talib, would you shun the religion of &#x27;Abd al-Muttalib?&#x27; The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, kept inviting him and repeating his words until the
last thing that Abu Talib said was: &#x27;I follow the religion of &#x27;Abd al-Muttalib&#x27;, and he refused to say, there is
no deity save Allah. At that point the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: &#x27;By Allah,
I will ask Allah for your forgiveness for as long as I am not forbidden from doing so&#x27;. Then, Allah, glorious
and majestic is He, revealed (It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of
idolaters even though they may be near of kin (to them) after it hath become clear that they are people of
Hell-fire)

[28:57]
(And they say: If we were to follow the Guidance with thee we should be torn out of our land…)

[28:57].
This verse was revealed about al-Harith ibn ‘Uthman ibn Nawfal ibn ‘Abd Manaf when he said to the Prophet,
Allah bless him and give him peace: “We know that what you say is the truth. However, what prevents us 
124
from following you is the fear that the Arabs will drive us out of our land, since they are unanimously against
us and we have no power against them”. Therefore, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse.

[28:61]
(Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find (true)…)

[28:61]. Abu Bakr al-Harithi
informed us&gt; Abu’l-Shaykh al-Hafiz&gt; Muhammad ibn Sulayman&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Hazim al-Ayli&gt; Badal ibn alMuhabbar&gt; Shu‘bah&gt; Aban&gt; Mujahid who said, regarding this verse: “This verse was revealed about ‘Ali,
Hamzah and Abu Jahl”. Al-Suddi said: “This verse was revealed about ‘Ammar and al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah”.
It was also said that it was revealed about the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace and
Abu Jahl.

[28:68]
(Thy Lord bringeth to pass what He willeth and chooseth…)

[28:68]. The specialists of Qur’anic exegesis
said: “This verse was revealed as an answer to al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah when he said, as reported by Allah,
exalted is He, in the Qur’an (And they say: If only this Qur’an had been revealed to some great man of the
two towns?)</pre>
