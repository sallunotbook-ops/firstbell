<pre>[93:1-3]
(By the morning hours, and by the night when it is stillest, thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate
thee)

[93:1-3]. Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi informed us&gt; Abu’l-Husayn Ahmad ibn al-Sarraj&gt; al-Husayn ibn alMuthanna ibn Mu‘adh&gt; Abu Hudhayfah&gt; Sufyan al-Thawri&gt; al-Aswad ibn Qays&gt; Jundub who said: “A
woman from the Quraysh said to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace: ‘I think your demon has
forsaken you’, and so it was revealed (By the morning hours, and by the night when it is stillest, thy Lord
hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee)”. This was narrated by Bukhari&gt; Ahmad ibn Yunus&gt; Zuhayr&gt;
al-Aswad and by Muslim&gt; Muhammad ibn Rafi‘&gt; Yahya ibn Adam&gt; Zuhayr. Abu Hamid Ahmad ibn al-Hasan
al-Katib informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Shadhan&gt; ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hatim&gt; Abu Sa‘id alAshajj&gt; Abu Mu‘awiyah&gt; Hisham ibn ‘Urwah&gt; his father who related: “Gabriel, peace be upon him, was late
in coming to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and this caused him tremendous distress.
Khadijah said to him: ‘Your Lord has forsaken you because of the distress He sees in you!’ And so Allah,
exalted is He, revealed (By the morning hours, and by the night when it is stillest, thy Lord hath not
forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee)”. Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hamid informed us&gt; Abu Bakr 
164
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Zakariyya&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Daghuli&gt; ‘Abd al-Rahman
Muhammad ibn Yunus&gt; Abu Nu‘aym&gt; Hafs ibn Sa‘id al-Qurashi who related that his mother has related
from Khawlah, a servant of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, that a dog entered
the Prophet’s house, went under the bed and later died there. Days passed by and the Prophet, Allah bless
him and give him peace, did not receive any revelation. He said: “O Khawlah, what has happened in my
house? Gabriel, peace be upon him, has stopped coming to me”. Khawlah said: “I will tidy the house and
sweep the floor”. When she tried to sweep under the bed, she felt something heavy. She got it out and
found it was a dog. She took the dog out and threw it behind a wall. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give
him peace, then came in with his jawbones trembling — whenever revelation came to him he shivered —
and said: “O Khawlah, cover me!” Allah, exalted is He, revealed to him (By the morning hours, and by the
night when it is stillest, thy Lord hath not forsaken thee nor doth He hate thee).

[93:4-5]
(And verily the latter portion will be better for thee than the former…)

[93:4-5]. Abu Bakr ibn Abi al-Hasan
al-Musayyabi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Dabbi&gt; Abu ‘Amr Ahmad ibn
Muhammad ibn Ishaq&gt; Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-‘Asqalani&gt; ‘Isam ibn Dawud&gt; his father&gt; al-Awza‘i&gt;
Isma‘il ibn ‘Ubayd Allah&gt; ‘Ali ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Abbas&gt; his father who said: “The Prophet, Allah bless him
and give him peace, saw what was going to be bestowed upon his community after him, and he was
delighted. However, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed (And verily the latter portion will be better
for thee than the former, and verily thy Lord will give unto thee so that thou wilt be content). He gave him
one thousand castles of pearls whose floors are made of musk which contain everything he requires of
spouses and servants”.

[93:6]
(Did He not find thee an orphan and protect (thee)?)

[93:6]. Al-Fudayl ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn
Ibrahim al-Sufi informed us&gt; Zahir ibn Ahmad&gt; &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ziyad al-Naysaburi&gt; Yahya
ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya&gt; &#x27;Abd Allah ibn &#x27;Abd Allah al-Hajbi&gt; Hammad ibn Zayd&gt; &#x27;Ata&#x27; ibn al-Sa&#x27;ib&gt; Sa&#x27;id
ibn Jubayr&gt; Ibn &#x27;Abbas who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said:
“I have asked my Lord for something I wish I had not asked for. I said: &#x27;O my Lord! There were prophets
before me, some of whom you had subjugated the wind - and he mentioned Solomon, son of David - and
some of whom could bring the dead back to life - and he mentioned Jesus, son of Mary - and some of
whom…, etc.&#x27;. Allah, exalted is He, responded by saying: &#x27;Did I not find you an orphan and protected you?&#x27; I
said: &#x27;Indeed, O my Lord&#x27;. Allah said: &#x27;Did I not find you wandering and directed you?&#x27; I said: &#x27;Indeed, O my
Lord!&#x27; Allah, exalted is He said: &#x27;Did I not find you destitute and enriched you?&#x27; I said: &#x27;Indeed, O my Lord!&#x27;
Allah, exalted is He, said: &#x27;Have I not caused your bosom to dilate and eased you of the burden?&#x27; I said:
&#x27;Indeed, O my Lord!&#x27; ”</pre>
