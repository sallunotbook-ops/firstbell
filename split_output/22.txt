[23:12-14], the Prophet dictated them to
him. When he reached up to (and then produced it as another creation), 'Abd Allah expressed his
amazement at the precision of man's creation by saying (So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!). The
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “This ['Abd Allah's last expression] is how it
was revealed to me”. At that point, doubt crept into 'Abd Allah. He said: “If Muhammad is truthful, then I
was inspired just as he was; and if he is lying, I have uttered exactly what he did utter”. Hence Allah's words
(and who saith: I will reveal the like of that which Allah hath revealed). The man renounced Islam. This is
also the opinion of Ibn 'Abbas according to the report of al-Kalbi. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Abdan informed us>
Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym> Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Umawi> Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-Jabbar> 
78
Yunus ibn Bukayr> Muhammad ibn Ishaq> Shurahbil ibn Sa'd who said: “This verse was revealed about
'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh. The latter said: 'I will reveal the like of that which Allah has revealed', and
renounced Islam. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered Mecca, this
man fled to 'Uthman [ibn 'Affan] who was his milk brother. 'Uthman hid him until the people of Mecca felt
safe. He then took him to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and secured an
amnesty for him”.

[23:1]
(Successful indeed are the believers)

[23:1]. The judge Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Hiri informed us by
dictation> the chamberlain of Ahmad al-Tusi> Muhammad ibn Hammad al-Abiwardi> ‘Abd al-Razzaq>
Yunus ibn Sulayman> Yunus al-Ayli by dictation> Ibn Shihab> ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr> ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn
‘Abd al-Qari’ who said: “I heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab say: ‘When the revelation came to the Messenger of
Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, one could hear at the level of his face buzzing like the buzzing of
bees. Once, he remained in this state for a while and then turned toward the qiblah, raised his hands and
said: ‘O Allah, give us more and do not take away from us; honour us and do not humiliate us; grant us and
do not deprive us; prefer us and do not prefer anyone over us; make us pleased and be pleased with us’.
Then he said: ‘Ten verses have just been revealed to me; whoever practises them will enter the Garden’. He
then read: (Successful indeed are the believers) up to the tenth verse’ ”. This was narrated by al-Hakim Abu
‘Abd Allah in his Sahih from Abu Bakr al-Qati'i from ‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal> Ahmad ibn Hanbal
from ‘Abd al-Razzaq.

[23:2]
(Who are humble in their prayers…)

[23:2]. ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad al-‘Attar informed us> Muhammad
ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Nu‘aym> Ahmad ibn Ya‘qub al-Thaqafi> Abu Shu‘ayb al-Harrani> his father> Isma‘il ibn
‘Uliyyah> Muhammad ibn Sirin> Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him
and give him peace, used to look toward the sky in his prayer, and so this verse was revealed (Who are
humble in their prayers).

[23:14]
(So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!)

[23:14]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Hafiz informed
us> ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Hayyan> Muhammad ibn Sulayman> Ahmad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Suwayd
ibn Manjuf> Abu Dawud> Hammad ibn Salamah> ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jud‘an> Anas ibn Malik who reported
that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be well pleased with him, said: “My words agreed with those of my
Lord in four instances. I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, why do we not pray behind the Maqam [were Abraham
stood to pray]’, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed (… Take as your place of worship the place where
Abraham stood (to pray)…)

[23:12] up to His words (… and the
produced it as another creation)

[23:14] were revealed, I exclaimed: ‘So blessed be Allah, the Best of
creators!’ and the end of the verse was revealed as: (So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators!)’ ”.

[23:76]
(Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not themselves unto their Lord)

[23:76].
Abu’l-Qasim ibn ‘Abdan informed us> Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Dabbi> Abu’l-‘Abbas alSayyari> Muhammad ibn Musa ibn Hatim> ‘Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Shaqiq> al-Husayn ibn Waqid> Yazid alNahwi> ‘Ikrimah> Ibn ‘Abbas who said: “Abu Sufyan went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, and said: ‘O Muhammad, I beseech you by Allah and our ties of kinship, we have eaten hair
mixed with blood’, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Already have We grasped them with punishment,
but they humble not themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray)”. Ibn ‘Abbas said: “When Thumamah ibn
Athal al-Hanafi was brought to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, as a prisoner
and the latter embraced Islam, he set him free. Thumamah returned to al-Yamamah and prevented the
people of Mecca from getting any provisions from al-Yamamah. Allah, exalted is He, sent upon Quraysh
years of scarcity until they were forced to eat animal hair mixed with blood. Abu Sufyan went to see the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘I beseech you by Allah and our ties of
kinship; do you not claim that you have been sent a mercy unto the worlds’. He said: ‘Indeed!’ Abu Sufyan
said: ‘But you have killed fathers with the sword and children with hunger’, and so Allah, exalted is He,
revealed this verse”.
