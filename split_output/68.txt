[69:12]
(…and that remembering ears (that heard the story) might remember)

[69:12]. Abu Bakr al-Tamimi
informed us> ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja‘far> al-Walid ibn Abban> al-‘Abbas al-Duri> Bishr ibn Adam>
‘Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr> Salih ibn Haytham> Buraydah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah
bless him and give him peace, said to ‘Ali: “Allah has commanded me to draw you closer to me and not
exclude you and that I teach you so that you understand; and Allah has taken it upon Himself that you
understand”, and then this verse was revealed (and that remembering ears (that heard the story) might
remember).
