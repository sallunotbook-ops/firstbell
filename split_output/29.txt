[30:1-3]
(Alif. Lam. Mim. The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land…)

[30:1-3]. The commentators of the
Qur’an said: “Chosroes sent an army under the command of a man called Shahryaraz to Byzantium. This
man marched on Byzantium and defeated them. He killed the men, destroyed their cities and demolished all
their olive trees. The Caesar had entrusted the command of his army to a man called Juhannas. The latter
fought against Shahryaraz at Adhri‘at and Busrah, which are the closest parts of Syria to the land of the
Arabs. The Persian defeated the Byzantines. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and his
Companions heard this while in Mecca and felt sad about it. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, disliked that the Magians, who did not have a revealed Scripture, have the upper hand over the
Byzantines who were people of the Book. The disbelievers of Mecca, on the other hand, were exultant and
spiteful. When they met the Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, they said to
them: ‘You are people of the Book and the Christians are people of the Book. We are without a revealed
Scripture and our brothers the Persians have defeated your brothers the Byzantines. If you ever fight us, we
will defeat you too’. Therefore, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Alif. Lam. Mim. The Romans have been
defeated in the nearer land) to the end of these verses”. Isma‘il ibn Ibrahim al-Wa‘iz informed us>
Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Hamid al-‘Attar> Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar> al-Harith ibn
Shurayh> al-Mu‘tamir ibn Sulayman> his father> al-A‘mash> ‘Atiyyah al-‘Awfi> Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri who
said: “When the Battle of Badr took place, the Byzantines had also defeated the Persians. The believers
rejoiced and so these verses were revealed (Alif. Lam. Mim. The Romans have been defeated) up to His
words (… believers will rejoice in Allah’s help to victory), i.e. the believers will rejoice in the defeat of the
Persians by the Byzantines”.
