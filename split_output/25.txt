[26:214], the
Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went toward al-Safa, climbed it and then called: ‘It’s
morning time, get ready!’ people gathered around him (some came in person and some sent their own
emissary). He said: ‘O Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib! O Banu Fihr! O Banu Lu’ayy! If I were to inform you that
horsemen at the foot of this mountain intend to raid you, would you believe me?’ They said: ‘Yes!’ He said:
‘Then, I am a warner sent to you against an imminent, tremendous chastisement’. Abu Lahab said: ‘May you
perish! You summoned us just for this!’ And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (The power of Abu Lahab will

perish, and he will perish)”.
