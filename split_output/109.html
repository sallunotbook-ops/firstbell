(When Allah&#x27;s succour and the triumph cometh…)

[110:1-3]. This was revealed when the Prophet, Allah
bless him and give him peace, left from the Battle of Hunayn. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him
peace, lived only two years after this battle. Sa&#x27;id ibn Muhammad al-Mu&#x27;adhdhin informed us&gt; Abu &#x27;Umar
ibn Abi Ja&#x27;far al-Muqri&#x27;&gt; al-Hasan ibn Sufyan&gt; &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Azizi ibn Sallam&gt; Ishaq ibn &#x27;Abd Allah ibn Kaysan&gt;
his father&gt; &#x27;Ikrimah&gt; Ibn &#x27;Abbas who said: “When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him
peace, returned from the Battle of Hunayn and Allah, exalted is He, revealed (When Allah&#x27;s succour and the
triumph cometh), he said: &#x27;O &#x27;Ali ibn Abi Talib! O Fatimah! Allah&#x27;s succour and triumph has come, I have
seen people entering the religion of Allah in troops, I therefore hymn the praises of my Lord and seek
forgiveness of Him, for He is ever ready to show mercy&#x27; ”.</pre>
