<pre>[83:1]
(Woe unto the defrauders)

[83:1]. Abu Isma‘il ibn al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Naqib&gt; his
grandfather Muhammad ibn al-Husayn&gt; Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Hafiz&gt; ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn
Bashir&gt; ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn Waqid&gt; his father&gt; Yazid al-Nahwi&gt; ‘Ikrimah&gt; Ibn ‘Abbas who said: “When
the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, first moved to Medina, its inhabitants were the worst kind
of defrauders, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Woe unto the defrauders: Those who when they take
the measure from mankind demand it full). After the revelation of this verse, they became honest in their
weighing”. Al-Qurazi said: “There were some merchants in Medina who defrauded others. Their transaction
were like gambling: buying by means of throwing a pebble on a specific merchandises (Munabadhah)
without stipulating any terms or agreeing a contract or by touching the merchandise without looking at it
(Mulamasah) or engaging in transactions which involve the risk of losing on both sides (Mukhatarah). And so
Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went
then to the marketplace and recited it”. Al-Suddi said: “When the Messenger of Allah arrived at Medina,
there was there a man called Abu Juhaynah. This man had two scales: he used one scale when he sold
things to people and the other when he bought from them. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”.</pre>
