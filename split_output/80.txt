[81:29]
(ye will not, unless (it be) that Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation)

[81:29]. Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn
Ibrahim al-Tha‘labi informed us> Abu Bakr ibn ‘Abdus> Abu Hamid ibn Hilal> Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Sulami>
Abu Mushir> Sa‘id ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz> Sulayman ibn Musa who said: “When Allah, Glorified and Majestic is He,
revealed (Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight)

[81:28], Abu Jahl commented ‘It is up to us; if
we wish we walk straight, and if we do not wish, we will not walk straight’. And so Allah, exalted is He,
revealed (ye will not, unless (it be) that Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation)”.
