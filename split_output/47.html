<pre>[48:1]
(Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory)

[48:1]. Mansur ibn Abi Mansur al-Samani informed
us&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Fami&gt; Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi&gt; Abu’l-Ash‘ath&gt; al-Mu&#x27;tamir ibn
Sulayman&gt; his father&gt; Qatadah&gt; Anas who said: “We were sad and depressed when we returned from alHudaybiyyah because of being prevented from performing the pilgrimage. Allah, glorious and majestic is He,
then revealed (Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory), upon which the Messenger of Allah,
Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘A verse has been revealed to me and it is more beloved to me
than the world and all that is in it’ ”. ‘Ata’ also reported that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “When the words of Allah,
exalted is He, (…nor know I what will be done with me or with you…)

[48:1-2]”.

[48:5]
(That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers
flow…)

[48:5]. Sa‘id ibn Muhammad al-Muqri’ informed us&gt; Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Madini&gt;
Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Saqati&gt; Yazid ibn Harun&gt; Hammam&gt; Qatadah&gt; Anas who said: “When the
verses (Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory that Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that
which is past and that which is to come…) were revealed, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah, Allah
bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Congratulations, O Messenger of Allah, for what Allah has given you;
but what do we get?’ And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (That He may bring the believing men and the
believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow)”. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Faqih
informed us&gt; Abu ‘Amr ibn Abi Hafs&gt; Ahmad ibn ‘Ali al-Mawsili&gt; ‘Abd Allah ibn ‘Umar&gt; Yazid ibn Zuray‘&gt;
Sa‘id ibn Qatadah who said: “The verse (Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory) was
revealed to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, upon his return from al-Hudaybiyyah. It was
revealed when his Companions were sad because they were prevented from performing the pilgrimage; they
had to do with offering their sacrifices at al-Hudaybiyyah. When this verse was revealed, the Prophet said to
his Companions: ‘A verse was revealed to me which is better than the whole world’. And when he recited it,
one man said: ‘Congratulations, O Messenger of Allah! Allah has told what will be done with you. But what
will be done with us?’ And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (That He may bring the believing men and the
believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow)”.

[48:24]
(And He it is Who hath withheld me’s hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them…)

[48:24].
Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us&gt; Muhammad ibn ‘Isa ibn ‘Amrawayh&gt; Ibrahim ibn
Muhammad&gt; Muslim&gt; ‘Amr al-Naqid&gt; Yazid ibn Harun&gt; Hammad ibn Salamah&gt; Thabit&gt; Anas who
reported that eighty men from Mecca came down mount al-Tan‘im intending to take on the Prophet, Allah
bless him and give him peace, and his Companions by surprise. However, he captured them and spared their
lives, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (And He it is Who hath withheld men’s hands from you, and hath
withheld your hands from them, after He had made you victors over them). ‘Abd Allah ibn Mughaffal alMuzani said: “We were with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, at al-Hudaybiyyah
close to the base of the tree which was mentioned in the Qur’an when thirty armed youths suddenly charged
on us. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, prayed against them, and Allah, exalted is He, took
away their sight. We then bounced on them and seized them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and
give him peace, asked them: ‘Have you come under the protection of someone? Has anyone given you a
guarantee of safety?’ They said: ‘No, by Allah!’ He let them go after which Allah, exalted is He, revealed
(And He it is Who hath withheld men’s hands from you, and hath withheld your hands from them…)”.</pre>
