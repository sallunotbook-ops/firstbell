[112:1-4]
(Say: He is Allah, the One! Allah, the eternally Besought of all…)

[112:1-4]. Qatadah, al-Dahhak and Muqatil
said: “A group of Jewish people went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said to him:
'Describe to us your Lord, for He has revealed His description in the Torah. Tell us: what is He made of? And
to which species does He belong? Is He made of gold, copper or silver? Does He eat and drink? Who did He
inherit this world from? And to whom will He bequeath it?' And so Allah, gloried and exalted is He, revealed
this Surah. It is Allah's specific lineage. Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Mihrajani informed us> 'Ubayd Allah
ibn Muhammad al-Zahid> Abu'l-Qasim ibn Bint Mani'> his grandfather Ahmad ibn Mani'> Abu Sa'd alSaghghani> Abu Ja'far al-Razi> al-Rabi' ibn Anas> Abu'l-'Aliyah> Ubayy ibn Ka'b who related that the
idolaters said to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace: “What is the lineage of your
Lord?” and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Say: He is Allah, the One! Allah, the eternally Besought of all).
The eternally Besought of all (al-Samad) is Him Who (begetteth not nor was begotten) for anyone who is
begotten will certainly die and whoever dies will be inherited. Allah does not die nor is He inherited. (And
there is none comparable unto Him), He does not have anyone who resembles Him or is like Him (Naught is
as His likeness…)
